  Heading Tags
  
  Heading tags are used to define headings in a web page. Headings are used by
  browsers, screen readers and search engines to create an outline of the page
  by defining the the importance of headings using numbered tags which range
  from <h1> to <h6>.

  <h1> would be the most important heading and <h6> would be
  the least important heading.
  -->

  <h1>Heading</h1>
  <!--
  You MUST start with an <h1> tag, use the headings in numerical order and MUST
  NOT skip from one level to the next.
  For instance, immediately after using an <h1> tag, you should use an <h2> tag
  and should not use <h3> to <h6> tags until you have.
  You could use another <h2> tag after using an <h2> tag though.
  -->
  <h2>Heading</h2>
  <h3>Heading</h3>
  <h4>Heading</h4>
  <h5>Heading</h5>
  <h6>Heading</h6>

  <!--
  Historically, there was a rule that you could only have one <h1> tag per HTML
  page but this rule was changed with HTML5. However, you may now only use one
  <h1> tag per sectioning content element

    <h1>Second Heading 1</h1>
    <!--
    Sectioning Content

    Sectioning content elements are elements which are used to define sections
    where the numbering of heading tags restarts.

    This means that every sectioning content element can have its own <h1> tag.
    However, every sectioning content element may only have one <h1> tag inside
    of it until another sectioning content element is created inside of it.
