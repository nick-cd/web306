Every HTML page uses the same basic universal template. This template starts
with a document type declaration which identifies the document as an HTML page
and defines the HTML version.

The document type declaration is defined by one self-closing tag:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html><!-- Defines document type -->
<!--
After the document declaration the rest of the HTML page is wrapped with
the opening and closing <html> tags which define the start and end of the document.
-->
<html><!-- HTML page starts -->
  <!--
  The first tag which goes inside of the <html> tags is the <head> tag.
  The <head> tag defines information about the page. It is like the brain of
  the web page. It is also used to import external files.
  -->
	<head><!-- Information about page starts -->
    <!--
    The word “meta” means something which refers to itself. Meta tags are tags
    that go in the <head> and provide information about the page. Every HTML
    page needs to have a meta tag which defines the character set at the
    beginning of the <head> tag. Meta tags are self-closing tags.
    -->
		<meta charset="UTF-8"><!-- Defines character set -->
    <!--
    Every HTML page should also have a <title> tag inside of the <head> tag
    which defines the title of the  web page that shows up in places such as
    the user’s browser tab and in Google searches.
    -->
		<title>My Cool HTML Page</title><!-- Defines title -->
	</head><!-- Information about page ends -->

  <!--
  After the <head> tag, every HTML page must have a <body> tag. The <body> tag
  is where all of the structural content of the page goes. of the page goes.
  If the <head> is the brain of the page, the <body> is the physical body
  of the page.
  -->
	<body><!-- Structure of page starts -->

	<!-- Structural elements and content go in here -->

	</body><!-- Structure of page ends -->
</html><!-- HTML page ends -->
