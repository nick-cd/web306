## Question 5

> Explain the MVC paradigm, identify and describe each of its three major concepts and explain how each relates to Laravel.

MVC is an [acronym](https://realpython.com/the-model-view-controller-mvc-paradigm-summarized-with-legos/) for [Model-View-Controller](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/model-view-controllermvc-architecture-for-node-applications/). As the expanded acronym suggests, it consists of three major concepts:

- **Model**  
  A **Model** is a class that defines instances that *map to data stored on a persistant storage medium (this includes [databases](https://web322.ca/notes/week07) or [files](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~ipc144/pages/content/files.html))* or holds any other vital data for the application. As standard OOP principles suggest, all operations performed on the data occur indirectly (through communication points, i.e. public methods) to allow for data validation/santization and possibly inserting of any other required logic given the problem domain.
- **View**  
  **Views** are the components of a web application that is visible to a user. In a typical MVC application, Views most likely contain dynamic content, being the data that is stored by the application's models. Thus, views must be [processed/rendered](https://coderwall.com/p/l-a79g/the-principles-of-the-mvc-design-pattern) before being displayed. Views should present the data that was processed in a user-friendly form. Views are also used as a way for the user to indirectly interact with with the controller.
- **Controller**  
  A **Controller** contains logic that instructs the Model to perform the nessesary CRUD operation based on the user's request. These operations are performed on the user's request via the view (as mentioned before). When the controller receives a request, it provides the instructions on how to create response to the end-user (with the assistance of the Model to perform the complex logic as mentioned before). In effect, this component essentially creates a [REST API](https://web322.ca/notes/week09).

**NOTE: for information about how each of these components relate to laravel, please see the MVC simplifications section in question 3**

The practice of using all three of these components within an application is known as the MVC paradigm. This paradigm specifies a relationship between these components that's familar to [developers](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~ipc144/pages/content/probl.html#sof)/[computer scientists](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/notes/0/#what-is-computer-science) etc. This relationship specifies a *linear* relationship between all of the components with regards to the [flow of data](https://coderwall.com/p/l-a79g/the-principles-of-the-mvc-design-pattern).

User's provide input and recieve output based on their input. Processing occurs between these two stages:

1. Users provide their input(from the View).
2. The input is recieved(Controller).
3. The application processes the input accordingly(Model); contains the main application logic.
4. Produce output that's displayed to the user(View is updated).

Note that steps 2-3 are the processing stages.
