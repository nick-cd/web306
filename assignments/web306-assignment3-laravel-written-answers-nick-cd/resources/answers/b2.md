## Question 2

> What is a namespace and what is it used for?

Namespaces allow programmers to create custom named scopes which encompass a group of related entites within an application. They allow for scoping of entities that would [otherwise be in global scope](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop345/pages/content/start.html#nam). In php, the amount of entities that are [actually affected by inserting their definition in a namespace is limited](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.definition.php).

We declare a namespace like so:

```php
<?php // in file namespace.php
namespace sdds; // namespace declaration

// ... The rest of code in this file is within the sdds namespace
class test {
  public $property = 3;
  // ...
}

const c_var = 10;

function func() {
  // ...
  return 0;
}
?>
```

[*It is also possible to declare multiple namespaces in the same file, though it is not ideal*](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.definitionmultiple.php)

We may re-declare a namespace in a another file to continue adding entities to the namespace. Multiple declarations of a namespace in separate files make up *its full definition*.

Note in php, a restriction exists with regards to how namespaces are defined: 

> ["A file containing a namespace must declare the namespace at the top of the file before any other code - with one exception: the declare keyword."](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.definition.php)

(Offical docs)

```php
// ... any possible other content (even whitespace as the offical docs suggest); declare keyword is allowed however ...
<?php
namespace sdds; // Wrong!

// ...
?>
```

Since namespaces create a scope (Also known as, namespace scope), visibility of declared entities is limited to the namespace its declared within. This allows [other namespaces to co-exist in the same application](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop244/pages/content/langu.html#nam) containing potentially repeating identifiers.

This rectifies the issue of possibility of breaking the [one-definition rule]() with different developers using the same identifier in different parts of the application (developers being third-party code part of an API/Library/Framework or other contributors to the same main application).

Using namespaces is a much better alternative to prefixing identifiers with extra information making them very long. (mentioned as [2 second problem alleviated in the offical docs](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.rationale.php), clarified by user [SteveWa](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.rationale.php#102662)).

To access an entity within a namespace in php, one possibility is to prepend the indentifier of the entity with the name of the scope it resides within. For example:

```php
<?php
require 'namespace.php'; // this file contains everything in the first code example above

$obj = new \sdds\test();

echo $obj->property . '<br/>';

echo \sdds\func() . '<br/>';

echo \sdds\c_var . '<br/>';
?>
```

Another possibility is to make `use` keyword ([offical docs](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.importing.php) provide a great example as well).

```php
<?php
require 'namespace.php';

// using a class defined within a namespace
use \sdds\test;

// using a function defined within a namespace
use function \sdds\func;

// using a constant defined within a namespace
use const \sdds\c_var;

$obj = new test();
echo $obj->property . '<br/>';

echo func() . '<br/>';

echo c_var . '<br/>';

?>
```

[sub-namespaces](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.nested.php) are often used to futher distinguish where the code in the namespace actually resides in the project directory layout (in fact this practice is part of the [PHP Standard Recommendations, specifically the 5th entry, index 4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) as it allows for easy auto-loading).

As displayed in the above two examples, namespaces allow for [selectively exposing](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop244/pages/content/langu.html#nam) different parts of the application at the programmer's discretion. This **enhances readability** by explicity specifying *where identifiers* come from and by the use of aliasing to make it clear what the enity is representing in context.
