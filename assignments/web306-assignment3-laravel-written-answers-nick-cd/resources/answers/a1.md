## Question 1

> What are static properties and methods and how are they used? What is a static class?

Both static properties and methods are known as [*static members of a class*](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop345/pages/content/class.html#var)(not to be confused with the term *static class*).

Here is sample code showing the use of the concepts (Insipired by the [offical documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.static.php#language.oop5.static.properties)):

```PHP
class test {
  private $property = 5;
  public static $static_var = 0;

  public static function static_func() {

    // $this->property // Wrong! $this can not be used in static methods.

    // In php, you must be explicit when accessing a static variable even in class context.
    // We use the 'self' or 'parent' keywords for this purpose 
    // along with the use of the scope resolution operator (::)
    return self::$static_var;
  }
}

$instance = new test();

// Accessing a static property - Both will work
echo $instance::$static_var . '<br/>';
echo test::$static_var . '<br/>';

// echo $instance->static_var . '<br/>'; // Wrong! Accessing static property test::$static_var as non static

// Calling a static method - All will work
echo $instance::static_func() . '<br/>';
echo $instance->static_func() . '<br/>';
echo test::static_func() . '<br/>';

// Interestingly works too (new feature from php 5.3)
$name = 'test'; // NOTE: cannot be equal to self, parent, and static
echo $name::$static_var . '<br/>';
echo $name::static_func() . '<br/>';
```

### Static Properties

A static property can be defined as being a [class variable](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop345/pages/content/class.html#var). It:

- has [static storage duration](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop345/pages/content/start.html#ent). It exists in memory for ["the entire life of the program"](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop345/pages/content/start.html#ent).
- has a sharable value across all instances of the class. Since that is the case it:
  - cannot be accessed with a particular instance with the [arrow operator](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.static.php#language.oop5.static.properties): '->' (as no instance 'owns' it). Doing So will throw the error: *Accessing static property ... as non static"*
  - enforces a requirement where it **must** be accessed with the use of *scope resolution operator* (::).
- cannot be initialized with an expression evaluated at run time (it must be initialized to a [const expression](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.constants.syntax.php), at least from php 5.6+).

Static Properties are used when the data does not hold state on any particular instance of the class. Rather the data held is relevant to all instances of the class.

### Static Methods

A static method can be defined as being a [class function](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop345/pages/content/class.html#var).

Static methods cannot make use of the `$this` *psuedo variable* as they are not called from within an [object context](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.basic.php). That is, an instance is not used to call the function (thus, `$this` has no object to reference). Since `$this` cannot be used, this also means they also cannot directly access non-static members within the class context (also known as class scope).

Static methods are used when the logic involves the class as a whole. They will most likely be used to [access/modify static properties](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop345/pages/content/class.html#var) (if any).

### Static Classes

A [static class](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-static-classes-in-php/) is simply a class that **exclusively** contains static properties and static methods.

Static classes have the benefit of being able to store internal (static) data and logic. This allows for abstraction, creating a simpler-looking module for clients.

*There does not seem to be many sources that make use of this term*
