## Question 3

> What is Laravel and what is it used for?

Laravel is a popular php framework. It brings together many useful libraries/frameworks, ideas, etc. This allows for:

- Rapid development, as all common functionality for web application creation is already in place and aviliable for use (see a list below)
- The enforcement of standard php programming practices most notably: [The Autoloading Specification](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/)

Laravel simplifies the creation of web applications in a [number of ways](https://www.educba.com/what-is-laravel/). 
Listed below are a few ways:

### Database management simplifications

Database simplifications come from Laravel's concept of a a *migration*.

Migrations the programmer creates inherit from the built-in class `Migration`. This newly created derived class (referred to as the [*Migration class*](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/migrations#migration-structure)) contains instructions on how to create a table within a schema that is to be associated with a model (see below). When the instructions are created, they will be **converted to SQL** (to the specific SQL dialect based on the database software in use) during a *migration* process. This alleviates the need to write creation scripts SQL code by hand which would be tedious as it involves a lot of trial and error.

The *Migration class* code also contains a timestamp which allows for [version controlling](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/migrations#introduction).

### MVC simplifications

Laravel was built from the ground to simplify the creation of MVC web applications specifically.

#### Models

Laravel provides [Eloquent ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent#introduction) library to simplify the creation of models(see question 5 for more details about what a model is).

[laravel-models](https://www.educba.com/laravel-models/)

Model classes the programmer creates will inherit from a the `Model` class provided by Eloquent. The `Model` class contains all the complex details on how to perform CRUD operations on the database. We simply provide details such as the table name, fields to store, what the PK (primary key is), if that PK is auto-incrementing and much more. All configuration is provided [by simply inserting protected properties in the *your* model's class definition](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent#eloquent-model-conventions). Your model class is also associated with database table which was created with the migration class (see above).

#### Views

Views are simpler to create with the readable syntax provided by the [Blade Template Engine](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/blade). *Echoing* data to the page is much more simple, it also comes with the added benefit that it **automatically escapes html that may be included within the data**

Blade introduces the concept of a *templates*, *sections* and *partials*, bringing the [DRY principle](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/33513/dry-principle) to front-end web development.

#### Controllers

Logic in the [controller class](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/container) to perform CRUD operations within a Laravel application has be simplified greatly with the help of the native [query builder](https://www.educba.com/laravel-query-builder/). The query builder is provided by the *model* the controller class to operating on.

Methods defined in our controller class which perform a specific CRUD operation also recieve a [Request object](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/requests). The `Request` contains all information about a particular HTTP request. The `Request` object makes it very easy to specify data that you require, the Request object will take responsibility of enforcing that. The Request object allieviates the need of the isset() function provided in pure PHP.
