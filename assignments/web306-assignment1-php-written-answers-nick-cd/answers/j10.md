PHPMyAdmin facilitates simplified interactions with a MySQL or MariaDB database management system as it features and graphical UI ([week 6 notes](https://github.com/senecawebprogramming/web306-day6-databases-sql-web306/blob/master/web306-day6-databases-sql-handout.pdf)).

PHPMyAdmin can be used for:

  - Writing SQL scripts (and running them)
  - Interactively creating tables without the use of SQL (It's often easier to visually see the table as it's being created).
  - Viewing relationships between tables (ER diagram) as well as each table's individual structure.

*These points were created based on how I understood PHPMyAdmin from the lecture.*
