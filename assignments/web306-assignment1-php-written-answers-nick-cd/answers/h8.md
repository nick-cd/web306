## Question 8

### Identify and define the four principles of object-oriented programming and explain in what way(s), each is used in PHP.

---

The *four* principles of object-oriented programming are:

  - **Encapsulation**
  - **Abstraction**
  - **Inheritance**
  - **Polymorphism**

[**Encapsulation**](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop345/pages/content/scope.html#ooc) is the principle where *all directly related* attributes and methods of a particular component are contained together. Inside of the type, the design is highly cohesive. There are two types of encapsulation:
  
  - **Weak Encapsulation** - No privacy implemented on any members. 
  - **Strong Encapsulation** - Implements privacy on unimportant details. The core idea of *abstraction*.

We use encapsulation to enforce [modular design](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~ipc144/pages/content/modul.html). That is, a class within a module must be focused in what it is attempting to achieve. All related operations are put together in one place (i.e. module).

[**Abstraction**](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop244/pages/content/objec.html#abs) builds off the idea of strong encapsulation. This is the principle where complex details are hidden from client code (code outside of the class) behind a clean interface. 

Objects may only be interacted with [indirectly with the use of public members](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop244/pages/content/cppst.html#pri) allowing *only* controlled operations to be performed on the state of the current object. This allows for enforcing any number of restrictions of the state of an object.

Public members in an object-oriented solution behave as ["comminication points"][object-interaction] which allow us to interact with the object in a declarative manner.

We use abstraction to ensure that instances of the class are [always in a valid state][object-interaction]. This is important as the state of the object most likely determines how the object is to behave with future logic that operates on the data.

[**Inheritance**](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop244/pages/content/inher.html#inh) (may have to down scroll a bit) is a *strong one-way structural* relationship between two or more classes (one class "is a kind of"/"is a type of" another class):

  - **Strong**, as in [high](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~ipc144/pages/content/modul.html#ana) [coupling](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3085285/difference-between-cohesion-and-coupling#3085419) (note, these are two links, you have to scroll for the first link)
  - **One-way** implies that the relationship is [transitive](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop244/pages/content/inher.html).  
  
  A child class came from the a parent class (thus, it is a type of parent class), however, the parent class may very well have more than one child each of which having their own unique additions. Thus, parents are not the same as each of their individual children creating a transitive (one-way) relationship.

  - **Structural** implies that a (child) class takes on all the attributes (AKA. properties in PHP) and methods that do not have special functionality associated with them (That is, methods considered to be ["magical"](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php) in PHP).

We use inheritence to be able to [reuse working/tested code](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop244/pages/content/objec.html#loo). By inheriting from existing code, it is only nessecary to write code that will be unique to the child class saving development time.

**Polymorhism**

(Note: In the context of **polymorphism** in object-oriented programming, we refer to this particular use of polymorphism as *Inclusion Polymorhism* taken from the idea of *universal polymorphism* as specified by [**Cardelli and Wegner** who discussed the categories of polymorphism](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop244/pages/content/adhoc.html). For conciseness however, I will simply refer to this concept as **polymorphism**).

**Polymorhism** builds off the principle of **Inheritance**. This is the principle where a type within a heierachy can refer to many different values. The set of permissible values that a type is able to refer to is determined by the class type itself as well as *including* (hence the name inclusion polymorphism, mentioned before) all the class types the derive from it (that is, classes that are children of the specified type). An object of such type is refered to as a [*polymorphic object*](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop345/pages/content/inher.html#pol). 

The operations that are able to be performed on a [*polymorphic object*](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop244/pages/content/inclu.html#obj) are determined by the type that was explicity specified upon the object's definition. This type specifies a common interface for all child types and possibly for itself too (if it is not an abstract class, in which case it would just be an interface for the child classes and nothing more).

We use **polymorphism** to [reuse logic created in the client code](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop244/pages/content/inclu.html#eff). Consider a function in client code which recieved a reference to parent class type. In polymorphic object-oriented design solution, that function may recieve the object of the type that was explicity specified (if it's not abstract) *or* any object of child class type without *any additional* logic required. The function itself [is not aware it was able to do that](https://stackify.com/solid-design-liskov-substitution-principle/) (that is, the behaviour happened transparantly to the client).
