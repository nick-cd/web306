## Question 2

### What are the $_SERVER, $_GET and $_POST superglobals and what are they used for?

---

**$_SERVER, $_GET, and $_POST** are each known as [*superglobals*][superglobals].

*Superglobals* are global variables that can be used anywhere by the programmer. ([week 3 notes, page 4](https://github.com/senecawebprogramming/web306-day3-superglobals-web306/blob/master/web306-day3-superglobals-handout.pdf))

Superglobals are used for:

- **$_SERVER** - Allows for querying information on anything regarding the execution of PHP code on the server side. This includes:
  - Current file being interpreted
  - Any HTTP Request information
  - Common Gateway Interface specification used by the server.
    Source: [server reserved variables](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php)  
    *Extra Note: [It is a responsibility of the web server to provide this information](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php)*
- **$_GET** - Allows for extracting information passed in a query string (the information after the '?' in the URL as key/value pairs) when the client makes a request ([web322](https://web322.ca/notes/week04)). The indices of the $_GET array are the keys which hold their corressponding value ([week 3 notes, page 5](https://github.com/senecawebprogramming/web306-day3-superglobals-web306/blob/master/web306-day3-superglobals-handout.pdf)).
- **$_POST** - Contains information recieved from the body of an HTTP POST request. $_POST is only populated when the HTTP request conatins:

> ["application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data as the HTTP Content-Type"](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.post.php)).
