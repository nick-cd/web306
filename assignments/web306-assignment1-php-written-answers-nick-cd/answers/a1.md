> "**PHP** is a [recursive acronym](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/php/php_introduction.htm#:~:text=PHP%20is%20a%20recursive%20acronym,build%20entire%20e%2Dcommerce%20sites.) for [**PHP: Hypertext preprocessor**](https://www.php.net/manual/en/preface.php)."

**PHP** at its core is used to insertion (or embedding) of logic within HTML files ([What is PHP?](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php)). It facilitates the ability to programmically control HTTP requests and responses (thus, allowing for the creation of dynamic websites). 

**PHP** is enclosed in a process instruction tag (PI tag).

PI tags consist of code to be preprocessed by some some interpreter:

```SGML
<? name
  code
?>
```

In the case of **PHP**:

- *name* will be replaced with `php` and
- *code* will be **PHP** code to be interpreted by the *Zend engine*.


Discussion on PI found in: [PHP Manual](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phpmode.php)

PHP is meant to be simple language for developers to promote rapid development. Rasmus Lerdorf (The founder of PHP) felt that there was a need for PHP as alternative options ([most notably, perl and c](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php)) were not viable ([PHP UK Conference 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1O4H5pz-c8)).
