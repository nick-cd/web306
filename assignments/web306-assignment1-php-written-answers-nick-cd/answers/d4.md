## Question 4

### What are properties in PHP and in what way(s) do they differ from variables?

---

[**Properties**][properties] are variables defined within a class. Properties dictate the current representation of a particular instance of a class (or object of that compound type). We typically refer to this representation as the *current state* of the that particular instance. Every object has it's own state (and thus, their own copy of the variables defined in the class) that is usually managed interally due to the ideas of encapsulation and abstraction (discussed in detail in question 8). In typical object-oriented solutions, it's usually not nessesary to need to know the current state as we are not modifying the data directly.

Note: **Property** is the **PHP** equivalent term for the more generic term *attributes* known to be used in [UML diagrams](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/).

Variables not defined within a class are simply storage locations in memory that we refer to by name which are used for computations.
