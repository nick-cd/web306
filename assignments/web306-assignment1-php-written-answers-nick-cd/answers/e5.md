## Question 5

### What methods in PHP and in what way(s) do they differ from functions?

---

[Methods](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop244/pages/content/cppst.html#mem) are functions defined within a class. Methods represent what a component of an object-oriented solution is able to do (and nothing more). They behave as communication points that disallow any invalid operations on the properties they hide.

[Functions](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop244/pages/content/objec.html) are simple abstractions in source code. They simply represent block of source code that would have otherwise been repeated multiple times throughout the source code. Instead of repeating logic, we simply create a function and refer to it by its symbolic name.

Regardless, functions in general are always focused with the tasks they perform. Related functions are placed are placed in the same module. Such a design is known to be considered [highly cohesive](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~ipc144/pages/content/modul.html).
