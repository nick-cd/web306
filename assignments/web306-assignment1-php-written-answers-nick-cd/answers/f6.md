## Question 6

### What are magic methods in PHP and in what way(s) do they differ from normal methods?

---

Magic methods are defined as *public methods* where their identifier begins with two underscore characters (`__magic_method_name()`) ([Offical documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php)). These methods are (seemingly implicitly) called when the client performs a certain operation with the object. This is useful when the object must do a required operation (a prerequiste operation) before it can do what the client wanted.

For example, to echo HTML code to the client, a restriction exists that requires the information provided to `echo` by the programmer must be a [string](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop244/pages/content/basic.html). This is done automatically for the fundamental types. However, for objects (that we create) that is not the case. Objects require the use of the `__tostring()` magic method when an object is passed to `echo` as an operand. As long as `__tostring()` was defined in the class, the client may *echo the object* without having to be concerned about the restriction mentioned before.

Note: these functions are [not hidden from the client]((https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php)). They may very well be called explicitly from the client if they choose to do so.
