## Question 3

### What is a class and what is an object in PHP?

---

[**Class**](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~oop244/pages/content/objec.html#cla) - Definition of the structure of a component in an object-oriented solution. Components are defined as being any noun. Classes (typically) define a strong relationship between attributes (which defines the component's state) and operations (which act on the attributes in a particular way).

Commonly known to be considered the blueprints of said components. It creates a new [compound type][compound].

**Object** - enitity of [compound type][compound]. Multiple enities of the same compund type share the same operations but will most likely have their own unique state (values of the attributes).

Commonly known as being an instance of a class (a class in action, similar to how a process is a binary in action having their own virtualized processor and virtualized memory region).
